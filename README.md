# Chat Box
Live chatting application that allows participants to create a room and chat with their friends in the room. While building this web-based application, I demonstrated a strong knowledge of React, Firebase, and RESTful methods to develop frontend design, client-side validations, and the Material UI.
- Utilized Redux for state management and Google Firebase Hooks for API calls to gain experience with up-to-date practices. Users can log in via a google account.
- Implemented firebase database for real-time updating which allowed instantaneous updates through chatting progress to be reflected.
